# Cube_Drag_And_Move
# Object oriented programming, inheritance, Java, GUI, Listeners, javax.swing

This Project is based on moving the components in JFrame using mouse and keyboard.
A cube is drawn on the frame and then it can be moved inside the frame either 
with mouse or keyboard.
This program supports rubber banding as well.
When moved with mouse, the cube moves its closest vertex to the mouse pointer
